# Question Answering with BERT

This exercise demonstrates the use of BERT's **Question Answering** capability. The model used in this exercise is a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on the SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset). The objective of the exercise is to answer questions based on a given context or passage.

### What does the exercise do?

- Loads a BERT model that is fine-tuned for question answering tasks.
- Takes a context and a question as inputs.
- The model processes the inputs and predicts the part of the context that contains the answer to the question.
- Finally, the predicted answer is extracted from the context and displayed.
